# DataCanvasDev Backend Development Guide

## Project Overview

This guide outlines a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to developing the DataCanvasDev backend using Express.js, PostgreSQL, and related technologies. The project aims to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable API for the DataCanvasDev platform, which serves as a portfolio and content management system for freelance web development and data science services.

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js (v18+)
- **API Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (v14+)
- **ORM**: Sequelize with Sequelize CLI for migrations
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh token rotation
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for media files
- **CDN**: AWS CloudFront for optimized content delivery
- **Image Processing**: Sharp.js for optimizing images
- **Email Service**: SendGrid for newsletters and contact form
- **Caching**: Redis for API response caching
- **Testing Framework**: Jest
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose

## Development Approach

The development will follow these principles:

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organizing code around business domains and concepts
- **Clean Architecture**: Separating concerns with clear layers (presentation, business logic, data access)
- **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests before implementation where appropriate
- **Continuous Integration**: Regularly merging code changes and running automated tests
- **Documentation-First**: Writing clear documentation alongside code development
- **Security-by-Design**: Implementing security measures from the beginning, not as an afterthought

## Getting Started

To begin development, proceed to [Project Setup and Configuration](01-project-setup.md).
